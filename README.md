    **Currently V1, so there probally will be more options soon.**

Curfew is specialized in a more internet type hacking, and can be used to target certain areas or targets.

  **Do NOT use this tool for un-ethical purposes, this tool was only made for cyber security.**
=================================================================================================
  
  Evem with Curfew still being a new and basic tool, it is still pretty powerful. It isnt like other tools, its really just a DDoSer but with more tools
  for being more precise on what/where you want to attack. 

  *This tool is still being worked on and will get better in the future.*

**NET STAT COMMAND IS CURRENTLY NOT WORKING AND IM WORKING ON FIXING IT.**
